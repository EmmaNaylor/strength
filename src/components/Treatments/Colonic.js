        <p className="treatment-text">
          In the clinic we use the natural closed gravity fed system with
          filtered water, a process from an ancient design. It is the safest,
          gentlest and most effective colonic, providing the greatest level of
          control working with the persons own bowel activity.
        </p>
        <p className="treatment-text">
          Colonic hydrotherapy gently fills the colon with warmed, filtered
          water through a small sterile rectal tube. As the water is released,
          it carries with it any material that has built up in the large bowel,
          such as trapped gas, toxins and matter.

          During your consultation a detailed medical history will be taken,
          helping the practitioner determine whether treatment is an appropriate
          treatment for you to receive and whether it will help you achieve the
          results you are expecting.

          During this consultation the potential risks and aftercare
