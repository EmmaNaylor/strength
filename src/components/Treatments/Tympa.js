        <p className="treatment-text">
        During your appointment your clinician will be able to assess your ears, and if wax is present, gently remove
it with microsuction. Microsuction is the gold standard of wax removal and is considered safer than other methods
such as irrigation.
        </p>
        <p className="treatment-text">
        Once wax has been removed a hearing screening can be performed. This will identify whether you have a level of
hearing loss. If you do have a hearing loss your clinician may refer you to an audiologist for further investigation.
However, in many cases, the initial problem couldâ€™ve simply been down to the presence of wax itself.
