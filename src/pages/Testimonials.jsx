          Amazing treatment and highly recommended. Jacky makes a huge
          difference and the positive effects really do last. Her nutritional
          advice is also spot on and is completely individually tailored.

          see what the next few days brings. Thank you so much Jackie I am so
          full of gratitude

          I had another great CranioSacral Therapy session with Jacky yesterday.
          This treatment is amazing. I could feel so much movement and energy
          moving around and both Jacky and I had visions during it. Jacky is a
          great therapist with a unique combination of medical and spiritual
          knowledge. She’s based at the Business Centre on Blackwell Lane in
          Darlington and I can’t recommend her highly enough!

          I had a CST session with Jacky last week and it was amazing! After
          treatment all my aches and pains had melted away but I also feel
          clearer and more focused than I had for ages. I really needed to
          remember Jacky’s advice about staying hydrated after therapy as I
          drank as much as if I’d been running all day! I could feel the
          energies moving around my body, clearing blockages and I will
          definitey be booking another session soon. Highly recommended.

          I have suffered with chronic back pain for the last 10 years, so decided
          to see Jacky for Craniosacral Therapy. As I had heard how good it was.
          The treatment itself is very relaxing and Jacky made me feel very at ease,
          but I was sceptical if it would help me or not. When I get home from work
          and sit down for awhile I always seize up and I'm in agony once I try to
          stand again. When I get out of bed on a morning I'm in a lot of pain until
          my pain meds start kicking in. But after one session with Jacky I noticed
          a difference straight away. There was no pain on an evening or when I got up.
          I know I will have to have a few appointments to getthe full benefit, but I 
          can highly recommend this treatment. Thank you Jacky x

          Brilliant practitioner, and really lovely and friendly lady. I've been seeing Jacky
          for a few months now for ongoing Craniosacral Therapy and emotional release to treat
          my PTSD. Jacky has helped release so much deep tension and stress held in my body
          to address the somatic part of my condition and helped in my recovery. It's crazy 
          how pressure in your neck can release so much tightness in your hips which sports
          massage can't shift. Jacky has also been an emotional support applying her knowledge
          and expertise from her other disciplines to guide me to live healthier and even gave
          me plenty of career advice during our chats! A true professional, I couldn't recommend
          her enough.
