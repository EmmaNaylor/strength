          Amazing treatment and highly recommended. Jacky makes a huge
          difference and the positive effects really do last. Her nutritional
          advice is also spot on and is completely individually tailored.

          I had a cranial sacral therapy on Monday not my first but Jackie is
          amazing so calming and such a beautiful soul and so knowledgeable. I
          certainly felt some shifts in my body and slept so well can’t wait to
          see what the next few days brings. Thank you so much Jackie I am so
          full of gratitude

          I had another great CranioSacral Therapy session with Jacky yesterday.
          This treatment is amazing. I could feel so much movement and energy
          moving around and both Jacky and I had visions during it. Jacky is a
          great therapist with a unique combination of medical and spiritual
          knowledge. She’s based at the Business Centre on Blackwell Lane in
          Darlington and I can’t recommend her highly enough!

          I had a CST session with Jacky last week and it was amazing! After
          treatment all my aches and pains had melted away but I also feel
          clearer and more focused than I had for ages. I really needed to
          remember Jacky’s advice about staying hydrated after therapy as I
          drank as much as if I’d been running all day! I could feel the
          energies moving around my body, clearing blockages and I will
          definitey be booking another session soon. Highly recommended.
